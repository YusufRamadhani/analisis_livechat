# analisis_livechat

This project is performing an ETL data from database to data warehouse. The transforming phase is text-based data from chat and preparing to consume by analysts. Transform process includes cleaning, preprocessing text, and taking out keywords to bigram.  

## What I've learned

* working in big data environment (Hadoop and hive)
* Working with a scheduler such as an Airflow
* Performing an ETL with deep text processing

## Mistakes and space to improve

* Too much logic syntax on dags file, harder to read and maintain
